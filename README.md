## The Project

### Scope/Purpose

This project was made as part of an college course for the studies Computer Science.
The main goal was to create an WebVR app with the A-Frame framework for the University of Applied Sciences Leiden, where it could be used to teach the general concept of the determination of bacteria.

In this VR environment the student would navigate through small and simple tasks where it would require the thought process which would be needed in a real lab.
Due to limitations only the general concept could be covered and not the real steps within the lab.

### The VR Environment

You can try the virtual environment at: https://aframe-webvr.web.app/ - automatic!

Use:
* Navigate by using (clicking) the black tiles on the floor
* Use the cursor to click on certain items to pick them up
* Click on levers, light bulbs (to get a hint) or red circles (for placing certain items) to interact with them

**Clicking - when the cursor is shirking your in the fusing event, during this time you can cancel the click by looking away**

**Note:** The app can be used with an mobile phone inside a Google Cardboard or other Mobile VR headsets, but can also be used with an Oculus, HTC or other VR headsets (Some location adjustments are needed for optimal navigation).

**Disclaimer:** This program is not a full release for commercial use and the whole application is made with the Dutch language in mind.
